FunctionGemma is a specialized version of our Gemma 3 270M model tuned for function calling. It is designed as a strong base for further training into custom, fast, private, local agents that translate natural language into executable API actions.

## When to choose FunctionGemma

FunctionGemma is the bridge between natural language and software execution. It is the right tool if:

- **You have a defined API surface:**Your application has a defined set of actions (e.g., smart home, media, navigation).
- **You are ready to fine-tune:**You need the consistent, deterministic behavior that comes from fine-tuning on specific data, rather than the variability of zero-shot prompting.
- **You prioritize local-first deployment:**Your application requires near-instant latency and total data privacy, running efficiently within the compute and battery limits of edge devices.
- **You are building compound systems:**You need a lightweight edge model to handle local actions, allowing your system to process common commands on-device and only query larger models (like Gemma 3 27B) for more complex tasks.
